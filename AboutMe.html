Hello, my name is Emiliano Gallegos, but those who know me call me Milo for short. I am a Junior level college student
and I am currently attending Bakersfield College. I am the second oldest out of a family of eight and was the only
son until three years ago when my little brother was born, however, I do have another little sister on the way.
I have a wonderful girlfriend of four years who has always been by my side and supports me in whatever I decide
to do. I work a full time job at Panera Bread right now to help me get through college but I feel like it's time to move
on from that job. Some hobbies that I like to do include: Fishing, Hiking, playing any sport, playing video games,
hanging out with friends, and traveling. I am a shy person at first but once I get to know you and spend time
together my personality is warm and welcoming. I am an extremely hard worker, dedicated, will learn anything to 
excel at a job, invested, and very honest. I want to get my foot in the door of the Programming world outside of college
and live the life that I set and want for myself.
