I went to Frontier High School for all four years and graduated with honors. I recieved the Golden State Seal award
which means I have recieved more than six A's in each subject throughout the school year. I also recieved a Seal of Biliterallcy
in Spanish for taking spanish and maintaining a grade of a B or better for all four years of high school. I graduated with a GPA 
of a 3.1 . After High School I wasn't sure if I wanted to go to college. I wanted to get a normal 9-5 job that would make 
money and I could start saving up and try to move out on my own however, my wonderful girlfriend convinced me that going
to college, graduating, getting an associates, and eventually getting a Masters was a better alternative than being an average
Joe and getting a 9-5 job where you are working towards someone else's dream and not my own.

She was finally able to convince me and help get me started on my way to Bakersfield College. At first I was not 
sure what major I wanted to do so I decided to take all of my GED classes first to get them out the way and to see 
what peaked my intrest. After the first couple of semesters at Bakersfield College, I finally settled on Computer Science
and Programming. I accidentally stumbled my way into a CompSci class while trying to find my counsolers office 
and they were working on C++ code. Fortunatly for me, the professor teaching that class let me sit in for the remainder 
of the class. I guess you could say he saw my expression on my face and noticed that coding struck me as  "cool" 
and let me sit in. I will always remember that professors name, Professor Miles and later on I would be come one of
his students. He taught his class extremely well and was very helpful with showing me the ropes of coding. Now that
I am done with all of my Computer Science classes, I am keeping in touch with my coding and trying to get even 
better than before. I only have three classes left at Bakersfield College and it is one Calculus two class and two Physics classes.
Once I am done with those, I will graduate and hopefully get accepted to UC Irvine, Fresno State, CSUB, Merced, or Long Beach.
